# Traffic Lights Simulator

This simulates a vehicle light and a pedestrian light. The vehicle light is always green until some pedestrian pushes the button. Then the light goes to yellow and then to red at the same time the pedestrian light goes to green.
If the button has been pushed recently, the vehicle light does not goes to yellow right away, it has to wait so the vehicle traffic is not congested.
